ArtClientMonitor
================
Provides a simple event interface for the [ArtClientLib-2.2.0](http://github.com/rjwut/ArtClientLib) client library for [Artemis SBS](http://www.artemis.eochu.com/).

This library primarily serves as an interoperability layer for my .Net projects, and is fully capable of being translated using the [IKVMC](http://www.ikvm.net/) tool into a .Net library. See build-dll.bat if you want to build a DLL.
