ArtClientMonitor
================
Provides a simple event interface for the ArtClientLib-2.2.0 client library for Artemis SBS http://www.artemis.eochu.com/.

This library primarily serves as an interoperability layer for my .Net projects, and is fully capable of being translated using the IKVMC tool into a .Net library. See http://www.ikvm.net/ for more information on that tool, or see build-dll.bat if you want to build a DLL.
